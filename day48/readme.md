Getting used to working with Selenium to work with browsers automatically.

Today, the goal was to create a bot that plays cookie clicker for you! Now, I only "needed" to work on Cookie Clicker Classic, which is located here... https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/

I also am in the process of creating a bot for Cookie Clicker (current version).
