The goal was to create a simple true/false quiz game while using the OOP paradigm.

THINGS I DID GREAT:
  - Get the program running to specifications
  - Began thinking about objects in the sense of classes
  
THINGS I NEED TO IMPROVE ON:
  - creating more methods within classes to make the code more readable, I am making too many calls in main.py and it's hard to follow

THINGS LEANRED:
  - Try your best to design and decide what classes you need FIRST
  - then think of the appropriate attributes for each class
  - really think about the best place a method fits
