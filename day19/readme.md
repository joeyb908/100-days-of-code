The hardest day yet!

The goal for today was to create six independent turtles that randomly race across the screen.

THINGS I LEARNED:
- OOP is very useful
- Tracking state for each object needs some sort of list that you can iterate through
- Random seems to be one of the most useful packages ever
- Not harcoding values into the program takes thought into how you need to structure your code

THINGS I NEED TO WORK ON:
- Rack my head around OOP objects and states some more (will come with more practice)
- Remember that lists are a great way to store information
