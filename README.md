# 100-days-of-code
100 Days of Code Bootcamp from Dr. Angelu Yu from Udemy from here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I try to complete at least one project a day. At this point in time (day 51), the projects seem to take a little more time than earlier in the course so
I may get through one every other day rather than my earlier rate of two/three per day. 

You know what they say (who is they anyways?)...
Practice makes perfect!
