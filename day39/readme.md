The goal is to create a personal mini-Travelocity script that searches for the 
cheapest available flight and sends an SMS to my phone when the price goes below a specified threshold.

The program uses three APIs:
1. Sheety - https://sheety.co/docs
    - Interact with Google Sheets
2. Twilio - https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms
    - Send SMS messages
3. Tequila - https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/docs
    - Flight data, prices, and more

I am definetely getting comfortable working with and manipulating JSON formatted files now. Accessing data and manipulating it
is becoming easier and easier, though it does take a bit of trial and error still.
