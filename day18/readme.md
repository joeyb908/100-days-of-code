Another day, another project!

This time, the goal was to use the turtle package to create a Damien Hurst "Spot Painting." 

Things I had to do:

- utilize colorgram package to extract the 30 most frequent colors
- break down said colors into their RGB format
- use the turtle class to create dots spaced out in a straight line
- return the starting position but a little higher so it replicates what the spot painting looks like

Overall, this project was fun, quick, and easy.

THINGS TO IMPROVE ON:
- identifying how to break down repeatable bits of code quicker so I don't need to refactor often

THINGS I DID WELL:
- utilize classes and come up with unique solution separate to the instructor's (I dare say better)
-   - better because I teleported the drawing aparatus to where it needed to go after each dotted-line instead of "moving" it across the screen
