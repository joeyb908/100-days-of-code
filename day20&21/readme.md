The objective here was to recreate the clasic game Snake...

THINGS LEARNED:
- OOP is very useful
- OOP makes code readable
- Inheritence is crazy
- Making a game is much harder than I thought it was
- List slicing
- Have all actions complete, then update the animation to avoid weird visual bugs

THINGS I NEED TO WORK ON:
- Realizing all the small things that go into a program
- Understand that it's okay to look at the documentation if I forgot how something works
