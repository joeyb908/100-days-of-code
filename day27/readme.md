Create a simple miles to kilometer program that has a GUI! Moving away from the terminal now...

THINGS I LEARNED:
- having to create every single piece of a GUI is probably going to be annoying
- grid format seems better than any other way to place items than absolute or packing methods

THINGS TO WORK ON:
- getting comfortable with what tkinter can do and how to utilize it properly
