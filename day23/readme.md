Create a Frogger / Crossy Road clone

LESSONS LEARNED:
- OOP isn't actually that bad to use once you start wrapping your head around it
- Try not to over-use it though... create functions in main to make it work, then apply it to a class if it makes sense
- Programming a game is much harder than I thought it would be
