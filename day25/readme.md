The goal was to create a program that takes two files. One, a letter with a placeholder value and one with a list of names.
Replace the placeholder value in the letter and replace it with the list of names.
Output each letter to a separate folder and separate file name for each letter.

THINGS I LEARNED:
- I will be using the OS module a lot, just like the random module!
- I/O seems like it will be very interesting and open up a lot of possibilities.
