Scratching the surface of the pandas package. There's so much you can do with it and it makes iterating through large datasets in rows/columns or key/value pairs
SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER. I have to get away from moving straight to thinking if I can solve it using for loops and see if I can use a panda method to solve easier.

THINGS I LEARNED:
- pandas is insane for going through data and finding information
- searching through documentation and stackoverflow sometimes feels like cheating
- even though pandas make it significantly easier, you still need to know how to utilize the tools at your disposal
- I have gotten pretty good at using for loops to search through dictionaries
