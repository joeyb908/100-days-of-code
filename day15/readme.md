Today focused on all the skills necessary to be able to loop through, access, and manipulate dictionaries.
Day 14 was very loop heavy so it makes sense day 15 would have been dictionary heavy.

Program requirements located in the PDF, but here they are simplified:
1. Prompt user asking what they'd like
2. Print a report when the user types "report"
3. Check if the 'coffee machine' is resource sufficient
4. Process coins and give change if needed
5. Can it actually go ahead with the process with provided change
6. Create the coffee and take away the resources.
