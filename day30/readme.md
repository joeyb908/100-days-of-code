Continue to improve on the password app...

updated to add:
- JSON data to store and search for passwords
- error handling to allow for separate scenarios

So far, the password allows for the following:
- entering a website's name
- entering (or setting a default) username/email
- entering a custom (or generating a strong random) password
- automatically copying generated password to clipboard
- searching for previously entered entries based on website name
-   - retrieving previously entered entries and associated username and pass
-   - puts retrieved password into clipboard as well
